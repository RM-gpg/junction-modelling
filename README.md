## 🛣️ Introduction
The **Junction Traffic Simulation System** is a web-based software solution designed to simulate and analyze traffic efficiency at a single four-way junction. Developed to meet a simulated commercial brief provided by Dorset Software Services for local government transport management, this system enables rigorous testing and comparison of junction configurations to optimize traffic flow, minimize congestion, and reduce emissions.

---

## 🌟 Features
### Adaptive Traffic Light Algorithm
- **Real-time Queue Analysis**: Adjusts green durations dynamically based on real-time traffic queue lengths, enhancing junction throughput.
- **Exponential Smoothing:** Ensures stable and gradual transitions between signal durations.

### Manual Traffic Configuration
- User-defined sequences allow stakeholders to explore alternative timings and strategies beyond adaptive defaults.

### Real-time and Accelerated Simulations
- Supports real-time visualization for intuitive understanding and rapid simulations (up to 10x speed) for swift strategic assessments.

### Comprehensive Analytical Reporting
- Quantitative metrics: Average wait times, maximum queue lengths, and maximum wait times.
- Efficiency scores calculated for direct comparison between various configurations.

---

## 🚗 Features
- **Interactive Parameters Input**: Comprehensive control over traffic and pedestrian parameters.
- **Comparative Leaderboards**: Tracks performance of manual and adaptive traffic algorithms across sessions.
- **Downloadable Data:** Easily export historical runs in JSON and CSV formats.
- **Tutorial System:** Embedded contextual tutorials accessible from all main pages.
- **Responsive Design:** Automatically adjusts simulation visuals to browser size for seamless viewing.

## 🔄 Traffic Simulation Algorithm
The adaptive algorithm optimizes green light durations using:
- Real-time queue measurements.
- Non-linear green duration calculations to balance immediate queue reduction and stable junction throughput.
- Independent handling of right-turning vehicles.
- Probabilistically timed pedestrian crossings based on configurable parameters.

---

## 📊 Leaderboard and Results Analysis
Leaderboards are computed using:

- **Score Difference Calculation**:  
  \[
  \text{Score Difference} = \text{Algorithm Score} - \text{User Score}
  \]

- **User Session Leaderboard:** Highlights best-performing user configuration based on efficiency comparisons.
- **Algorithm Session Leaderboard:** Tracks adaptive algorithm performance, allowing direct comparison.
- **Top 10 All-Time Leaderboard:** Persistent tracking of the most effective configurations historically.
